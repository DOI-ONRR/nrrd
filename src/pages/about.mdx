# About This Site

The United States is a major developer of natural resources. The Department of the Interior (DOI) collects billions of dollars in annual revenue 
from companies that lease <GlossaryTerm>federal lands and waters</GlossaryTerm> in order to develop oil, gas, or mineral 
resources. These revenues are <Link href="/explore/#federal-disbursements">disbursed</Link> to the U.S. Treasury, other federal agencies, states, 
Native American tribes, and individual Native American mineral owners.

This site provides data and contextual information about how natural resources and their revenues are managed in the U.S.

## History

This site was originally built to support the United States' participation in the [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)](https://eiti.org/), 
which the U.S. joined in 2011.

In November 2017, the U.S. decided to no longer formally implement the <GlossaryTerm>EITI Standard</GlossaryTerm>, but remains a strong supporter of 
good governance and the principles of transparency represented by the EITI.
