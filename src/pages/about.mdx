Companies that lease <GlossaryTerm>federal lands and waters</GlossaryTerm> to develop oil, gas, or mineral resources pay revenue to DOI. These revenues are <Link href="/how-revenue-works#understanding-federal-disbursements">disbursed</Link> to the U.S. Treasury, other federal agencies, states, Native American tribes, and individual Native American mineral owners.
<br />
This site provides data and contextual information about how natural resources and their revenues are managed in the U.S.
