# Data by State

Select a state to learn more about energy and minerals produced on federal land in that location. Each state page includes direct links to [Explore Data](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/explore) or  [Query Data](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/query), with those tools filtered for the selected state.


Some states are excluded from this list, because it only includes states for which ONRR has data.
