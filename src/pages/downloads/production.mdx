## Scope

These datasets include natural resource production for Native American lands and U.S. federal lands and offshore areas.  Neither dataset includes privately owned lands or state-owned lands.
<br />

Federal production data is available by location, but Native American data is only available at the national level to protect private and personally identifiable information.
<br />

The dataset currently include data tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR). The production data for Oil and Gas is collected on Form ONRR-4054 (Oil and Gas Operations Report). Coal and hardrock production is collected on Form ONRR-4430 (Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report).

## About the data

### Why is geothermal energy listed so many times?

We can only compare production that is reported in the same unit. The standard unit of measurement for geothermal energy in the federal production dataset is kilowatt hours, but there are a few counties that report it differently. We have separate charts for each of these counties, because they report in nonstandard units:

* Dona Ana County, NM reports direct use of geothermal resources in _million gallons_
* Churchill County, NV reports direct use of geothermal resources in _hundred gallons_
* Lassen County, CA reports direct use of geothermal resources in _million BTUs_
* Lassen County, CA reports geothermal energy generation as _other_ (no unit)
* Lake County, CA; Sonoma County, CA; and Beaver County, UT report geothermal energy generation in _thousand pounds_
* Inyo County, CA reports sulfur from geothermal resources as _long tons_

### A note about “Mixed Exploratory” versus “Federal” categories of production

To build our data visualizations, we've aggregated production from two types of jurisdictions: “federal” and “mixed exploratory.”

* Federal production is production from federal lands and waters.
* “Mixed exploratory” is a temporary jurisdictional unit that is used until production is proven on that location. BLM then creates a permanent unit with allocation schedules that may split that area between federal and other ownership. Payors then resubmit royalties based on the new unit allocations. These royalties are retroactive to the first production.

The federal government rarely gets 100% of “mixed exploratory” volumes. You can see these categories disaggregated in the federal production dataset, downloadable on this page.

<h3 alt="Quartz crystal units">Why is quartz crystal measured in “tickets/pounds”?</h3>

Quartz crystal is sometimes sold in relatively small quantities in gift shops and tourist attractions. In some cases, tourists can buy admission tickets to dig for their own minerals. For those transactions, ONRR may collect royalties on the admission tickets, not on the weight of minerals collected. Furthermore, some minerals are sold by quality, not by weight.
<br />
The unit “tickets/pounds” shows quantities measured in both tickets sold and weight sold combined, even though the units measure different things. The royalty amount for ticket transactions often don't meet ONRR's review threshold, so the specific quantities in weight may be unknown.

### Fields and definitions

**Year**
* **Calendar Year**  the period between January 1 and December 31 for a given year
* **Fiscal year**  The year the production occurred. The federal fiscal year runs from October 1 of the prior year through September 30 of the year being described. For example, Fiscal Year 2018 is between October 1, 2017, and September 30, 2018.

**Land Category**
  * **Onshore**  Situated or occurring on land
  * **Offshore**  Submerged lands located farther than three miles off a state’s coastline, or three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico off of Texas and Western Florida.

**Land Class**
  * **Federal**  Federal lands are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government, including: Public domain lands, acquired lands, military acquired lands, and Outer Continental Shelf.
  * **Native American**  includes Tribal lands held in trust by the federal government for a tribe’s use, and allotments held in trust by the federal government for individual Native American use.
  * **Mixed Exploratory**  is a temporary jurisdictional unit that is used until production is proven on that location (see above).

**State** The state where the production occurred
<br />

**County** The county where the production occurred
<br />

**FIPS Code** Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is a five-digit code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the U.S., certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states. The first two digits are the FIPS state code and the last three are the county code within the state or possession.
<br />

**Offshore Region** BOEM separates offshore areas into four regions: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska. For more information on offshore regions, including spatial boundaries, see BOEM's [maps and GIS data](http://www.boem.gov/Maps-and-GIS-Data/).
