## Scope

These datasets include natural resource production for federal lands, federal waters, and Native American lands. These datasets do not include privately owned lands or state-owned lands.
<br />

Federal production data is available by location. Native American data is only available at the national level to protect private and personally identifiable information.
<br />

The Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) tracks and manages this data.
- Oil and Gas production is collected on Form ONRR-4054-B (Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part B). 
- Solid mineral production is collected on Form ONRR-4430 (Solid Minerals Production and Royalty Report). 
- Geothermal sales volumes are obtained from the Form ONRR-2014 (Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance).

## Data publication

We update both the calendar year and fiscal year datasets on an annual basis. Final production numbers are not available for 3-4 months, so these datasets are updated 3-4 months after the end of the fiscal and calendar years.

## Annual totals and monthly totals

The annual totals in this production by year data may not be equivalent to the sum of 12-month production totals (for a given calendar or fiscal year) found in the production by month data.
  [Production by month data](/downloads/production-by-month/)
While the production volume (amount of a commodity coming out of the ground) doesn't change, the way it is accounted for might. There are two main reasons why:

- Operators may not report on time, meaning production for a past month might increase when the operator submits the report and ONRR updates the data.

- The Bureau of Land Management may choose to change agreements and units after production. These changes may affect the allocation of the production volume, changing the data.

For example, changing an agreement retroactively may change the allocation of production among states, the federal government, and Native American tribes and individuals. As a result, the apportioned totals in the data would change.

## About the data

### Why is geothermal energy listed so many times?

We can only compare production that is reported in the same unit. The standard unit of measurement for geothermal energy in the federal production dataset is kilowatt hours, but a few counties report it differently. We have separate charts for each of these counties because they report in nonstandard units:

* Dona Ana County, NM reports direct use of geothermal resources in _million gallons_.
* Churchill County, NV reports direct use of geothermal resources in _hundred gallons_.
* Lassen County, CA reports direct use of geothermal resources in _million BTUs_.
* Lassen County, CA reports geothermal energy generation as _other_ (no unit).
* Lake County, CA; Sonoma County, CA; and Beaver County, UT report geothermal energy generation in _thousand pounds_.
* Inyo County, CA reports sulfur from geothermal resources as _long tons_.

### A note about “Mixed Exploratory” versus “Federal” categories of production

To build our data visualizations, we aggregated production from two types of jurisdictions: “federal” and “mixed exploratory.”

* Federal production is production from federal lands and waters.
* “Mixed exploratory” is a temporary jurisdictional unit. It is used until production is proven on that location. BLM then creates a permanent unit with allocation schedules that may split that area between federal and other ownership. Payors then resubmit royalties based on the new unit allocations. These royalties are retroactive to the first production.

The federal government rarely gets 100% of “mixed exploratory” volumes. These categories are disaggregated in the federal production dataset, downloadable on this page.

### Why is quartz crystal measured in “tickets/pounds”?

Quartz crystal is sometimes sold in relatively small quantities in gift shops and tourist attractions. In some cases, tourists can buy admission tickets to dig for their own minerals. ONRR may collect royalties on the admission tickets, not on the weight of minerals collected. Some minerals are sold by quality, not by weight.
<br />
The unit “tickets/pounds” shows quantities measured in both tickets sold and weight sold combined. The royalty amount for ticket transactions often does not meet ONRR's review threshold, so the specific quantities in weight may be unknown.

### Fields and definitions

**Year**
* **Calendar Year:** The period between January 1 and December 31 for a given year.
* **Fiscal Year:**  The year the production occurred. The federal fiscal year runs from October 1 of the prior year through September 30 of the year being described. For example, Fiscal Year 2018 is between October 1, 2017, and September 30, 2018.

**Land Class**
  * **Federal:** [Federal lands (PDF) <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42346.pdf) are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Federal lands include: public domain lands, acquired lands, military acquired lands, and the [Outer Continental Shelf <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/outer-continental-shelf).
  * **Native American:**  Includes Tribal lands held in trust by the federal government for a tribe’s use, and allotments held in trust by the federal government for individual Native American use.
  * **Mixed Exploratory:**  A temporary jurisdictional unit. It is used until production is proven on that location (see above).

**Land Category**
  * **Onshore:**  Situated or occurring on land.
  * **Offshore:**  Submerged lands located farther than three miles off a state’s coastline, or three marine leagues into the Gulf off Texas and western Florida.

**State:** The state where the production occurred.
<br />

**County:** The county where the production occurred.
<br />

**FIPS Code:** Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is a five-digit code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the U.S., certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states. The first two digits are the FIPS state code and the last three are the county code within the state or possession.
<br />

**Offshore Region:** BOEM separates offshore areas into four regions: Gulf, Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska. For more information on offshore regions, including spatial boundaries, see BOEM's [maps and GIS data <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/mapping-and-data).
