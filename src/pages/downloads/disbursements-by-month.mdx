## Scope

This dataset includes natural resource disbursements for U.S. federal lands, federal offshore areas, and Native American lands. It does not include privately owned lands or U.S. state lands. Disbursements of revenue from extractive activities on U.S. federal lands occur bi-weekly. 
<br />

The dataset is tracked and managed by the Department of the Interior’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The data contains disbursement payments by month to state and local governments, designated funds, and the U.S. Treasury. The data is presented by month, from October 2014 through the most recently available month.

## Data publication

We publish the monthly file when we receive the data for the most recently available month, which is usually 1–2 months prior to the current month.
