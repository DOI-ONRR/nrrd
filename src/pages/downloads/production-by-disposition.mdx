# Production disposition by month

This dataset contains monthly production disposition volumes from ONRR’s OGOR-B form. These volumes come from the production of oil and gas. Production locations include federal lands, federal waters, and Native American lands.
<br />

This data is available from January 2003 through the most recently available month, which is usually 3-4 months prior to the current month. The historical dataset contains data from January 2003 through December 2013 and is not updated. The dataset starting with January 2014 is updated monthly.
<br />

This dataset contains monthly information on the disposition of production for each product (oil and gas) produced. The product could have been:
* directly removed/sold
* directly used (injected)
* moved off the lease
* transferred to a different facility
* flared, spilled and/or lost
* lost through evaporation/shrinkage

## Scope

This dataset includes oil and gas production for U.S. federal lands, federal waters, and Native American lands. This dataset does not include privately owned minerals or U.S. state minerals. Federal production data is available by location. Native American data is only available at the national level to protect private and personally identifiable information.
<br />
The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) manages this dataset. The production disposition data for oil and gas is collected on Form ONRR-4054-B (Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part B).
<br />

## Data publication

We update this production data every month, but final production numbers aren't available for 3-4 months. For example, the most recent production data for a file updated in November will be from July or August.

## About the data

A note about “mixed exploratory” versus “federal” production categories. To build our data visualizations, production was combined from two types of jurisdictions: “federal” and “mixed exploratory.”

* **Federal** is production from federal onshore and offshore minerals.

* **Mixed Exploratory** is a temporary jurisdictional unit. It is used until production is proven on that location. It comprises federal and/or Native American minerals, with other mineral ownership. Utilizing “mixed exploratory” helps drilling and production proceed in the most efficient and economical manner.

### Fields and definitions

** Production Date:**  The date in which the production occurred.
<br />

**Land Class:**  This field distinguishes federal lands and waters from Native American lands.

* **Federal:**  Includes [federal lands (PDF) <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42346.pdf) that are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Federal ownership includes public domain, acquired, military acquired, and  [Outer Continental Shelf <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/outer-continental-shelf).
* **Native American:**  Includes tribal lands held in trust by the federal government for a tribe’s use. It also includes allotments held in trust by the federal government for individual Native American use.
* **Mixed Exploratory:** A temporary jurisdictional unit that is used until production is proven on that location (see above).
<br />

**Land Category:**  This field distinguishes between onshore and offshore production.

* **Onshore:**  Situated or occurring on land.
* **Offshore:**  Submerged lands located farther than three miles off a state’s coastline. For the Gulf of America, offshore is three marine leagues from Texas and Western Florida.
<br />

**State:** The state where the production occurred.
<br />

**County:** The county where the production occurred.
<br />

**FIPS Code:** The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code is a five-digit code which uniquely identifies counties and county equivalents in the U.S., certain U.S. possessions, and certain freely associated states. The first two digits are the FIPS state code and the last three are the county code within the state or possession.
<br />

**Offshore Region: ** BOEM separates offshore areas into four regions: Gulf of America, Atlantic, Pacific, and Alaska. For more information on offshore regions, including spatial boundaries, see BOEM's [maps and GIS data <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/mapping-and-data).
<br />

**Disposition Code:** This field is a two-digit code indicating the means of product removal from the report entity.
<br />

**Disposition Description:** This field describes how the oil or gas is used and/or where it goes.

**Commodity:** Products are listed individually but may also fall into like categories.

  * **Oil Prod Vol (bbl):**  Oil production, measured in barrels (bbl).
  * **Gas Prod Vol (Mcf):**  Gas (natural gas), measured in thousand cubic feet (Mcf).


**Volume:**  Shows the production volume (amount produced). The units for volume are shown in the preceding field (Commodity).
