## Data collection and validation
---
As a steward of natural resources and energy revenue, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) handles three main functions. These functions are: collecting the revenue, verifying the revenue, and disbursing the revenue. ONRR collects and manages data to do its tasks. This data is the foundation for this site’s production, revenue, and disbursement datasets. [Learn more about data collection and validation.](/downloads/data-collection-validation/)
