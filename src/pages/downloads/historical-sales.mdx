# Historical sales data for oil, gas, and solids

These datasets contain historical sales data reported on Form ONRR-2014 and Form ONRR-4430.
<br />
The data is divided into 2 separate downloadable datasets:
  1.	Historical Form ONRR-2014 sales data from 1984 – 2025, including oil, gas, and solids products
  2.	Historical Form ONRR-2014 sales data from 1984 – 2025, containing only solid products from leases associated with a mine

## Scope

From 1984 – 2001, sales of all products (products from oil and gas leases, and leases associated with a mine) were reported in the Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (Form ONRR-2014). 
<br />
After 2001, leases associated with mines were reported separately in the Solid Mineral Production and Royalty Report (Form ONRR-4430). 
<br />
The Form ONRR-2014 dataset contains some solids information after 2001. Some solids reporters continued to use this form erroneously, and most of the reported data was removed (showing negative values). 
Both datasets contain reported volumes for royalty and non-royalty bearing transactions by calendar year. Sales data represents sales transactions that took place within a given calendar year.
<br /> 
These datasets include natural resource information for federal lands, federal waters, and Native American lands. These datasets do not include privately owned lands or state-owned lands.

## Data publication

These datasets were published on [Month Day, Year]. 
<br /> 
These datasets support historical data digitization efforts by the U.S. Geological Survey:

## About the data

### What is the difference between sales year and accounting year data? 

The federal sales dataset is sales year data reported on a calendar year basis. Although sales year and accounting year appear similar, there are key differences:  
<br />
<b>Sales year</b> data includes sales transactions records for a specific year* without adjustments for previous years. This data provides a snapshot of reported sales. It is useful for analyzing sales trends and comparing them to production volumes. The data changes, so ONRR publishes them with an as-of date. The federal sales dataset is sales year data reported on a calendar year basis.
<br /> 
<b>Accounting year</b> data includes sales transaction records accepted by ONRR within a specific year* with adjustments for previous years. The data shows the money ONRR collected and disbursed from the current year and any adjustments or corrections for previous years. It does not provide accurate trend analyses of sales values or volumes over time.
<br />
*federal fiscal year or calendar year

### What is the difference between sales volume and units produced?

On Form ONRR-2014, **sales volume** is the quantity and quality of production as measured at the approved royalty measurement point. It is then sold. The Bureau of Land Management or Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement approve measuring points.
<br />
On Form ONRR-4430, **units produced** is the total volume of production reported by a mine. That entire volume is not necessarily sold. Mines often leave production on site until it is ready to be sold. 

### Why is some data listed at “SENSITIVE”?

In both datasets, some data is replaced with the word “SENSITIVE” in the Units Produced, Sales Volume, and RVLA columns. This data is omitted because it is proprietary information. Sensitive business information is withheld to protect the competitive interests of companies. This action is legally required to safeguard confidential financial data provided by lessees. Data is often considered sensitive when there are less than 3 reporters or less than 3 leases for a given commodity.

### What are product codes? 

Product codes define the product and commodity on Form ONRR-2014 and Form ONRR-4430. See product code tables below for the full list of products.

### Fields and definitions

**Sales Year:** This dataset is sales year data reported on a calendar year basis. 
<br />

**Land Category:**

* **Acquired:** Public lands that the federal government obtained through purchase, gift, exchange, or condemnation.

* **Federal:**  [Federal lands (PDF)<OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42346.pdf) are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Federal lands include: public domain lands, acquired lands, military acquired lands, and the [Outer Continental Shelf <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/outer-continental-shelf).

* **Indian:** Includes Tribal lands held in trust by the federal government for a tribe’s use, and allotments held in trust by the federal government for individual Native American use.

* **Military and Misc.:** Federal land that was purchased by the federal government under military acquisition laws. 

* **Onshore Agreement:** Federal or Indian lands that are grouped together by an official agreement for the purpose of exploration and production. 

* **Other:** Corresponds to land category code 99, which is a Bureau of Land Management code for land not covered by the [Public Land Survey System <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://mlrs.blm.gov/s/article/PLSS-Information).

* **Outer Continental Shelf:** Federal submerged lands seaward of U.S. coastal states' jurisdiction. It is managed by the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/outer-continental-shelf) and regulated by the [Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.boem.gov/oil-gas-energy/leasing/ocs-lands-act-history). 

* **Private Acquired:** A private oil and gas lease that is acquired by a federal agency. This happens when the federal government obtains surface and mineral rights through purchase, gift, condemnation, or exchange.

* **Public:** U.S. federal lands and federal offshore areas where the government retained the land from its original territorial holdings. 

* **Public and Acquired:** A combination of both public and acquired lands, as defined above.

**Not Tied to Commodity:** Some royalties do not directly result from the production of a commodity. These are reflected in the dataset with product code 0, 00, and “blank”. For example, estimated royalty payments, interest on leases, and minimum rent payments are all monies related to a lease but not tied to a commodity.
<br />

**Commodity:** The Department of the Interior collects sales data on over 60 different commodities. Most sales come from oil, gas, and coal, but many other commodity categories are also included in these datasets.
<br />

**Product:** Products are listed individually but may also fall into like categories. See product code tables for the full list of products.
<br />

**Sales Volume:** A reported field on the Form ONRR-2014. Sales Volume is the quantity and quality of production as measured at the approved royalty measurement point. It is then sold. The Bureau of Land Management or Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement approve measuring points.
<br />

**Units Produced:** A reported field on the Form ONRR-4430. Units produced are the quantity of reported production, but that quantity is not necessarily sold.
<br />

**Royalty:** A natural resource lease holder pays royalties after the lease starts producing a commodity in paying quantities. The amount is based on a percentage of the revenue from the commodity sold. The exact percentage is set in the original lease document that went along with the lease sale.
<br />

**Royalty Value Less Allowances (RVLA):** Calculated by subtracting allowances (transportation, processing) from royalty value.
