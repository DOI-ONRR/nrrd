# Sales data

We offer sales data by calendar year. This sales data represents sales transactions that took place within a given calendar year. The dataset is for calendar years 2013-2022.

## Scope

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) recommended that The Department of the Interior's Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) calculate the effective royalty rate for federal oil and gas leases. To meet the OIG’s recommendation, ONRR collects the data from the Sales and Royalty Remittance Report, Form ONRR-2014, which contains information on royalties due based on sales or use of the oil and gas production. This dataset is called sales data because it is pulled from Form ONRR-2014.
<br />
The dataset includes sales data for U.S. federal lands and offshore areas for oil and gas. It does not include Native American land, privately-owned lands or U.S. state lands. The data set includes all ONRR Form-2014 federal reported royalty transaction codes, royalty relief codes, and TC 13 Quality Bank Adjustments.
<br />

## Data publication

The sales dataset is updated annually. 

## About the data

### What is the equation used to calculate the effective royalty rate?

The equation recommended to ONRR by the OIG to calculate the effective royalty rate is: 
<br />
Effective Royalty Rate = Total Royalty Value−Deductions ±Gravity Bank Adjustments/Total Sales Value 
<br />
Note: This data set uses RVPA to refer to Total Royalty Value. 

### What is the difference between sales year and accounting year data? 

Although they appear similar, there are key differences:  
<br />
Accounting Year data represent all transactions that ONRR accepted into our Financial System during a given fiscal or calendar year. This dataset contains transactions for sales that took place in the current federal fiscal or calendar year, as well as adjusted or corrected transactions for sales that took place in previous fiscal years. Because revenues are generally disbursed in the same year they were reported and accepted into ONRR’s Financial System, Accounting Year data are most useful when analyzing dollars ONRR collected and disbursed in a given federal fiscal or calendar year. Because they include adjusted or corrected transactions for previous sales periods, Accounting Year data should not be used for trending purposes or for analyzing sales volumes.  
<br /> 

Sales Year data represent sales transactions that took place in a given federal fiscal or calendar year and do not include adjusted or corrected transactions for sales that took place in previous years. This data set provides a “snap shot” of reported sales of mineral commodities, and is most useful when trending sales volumes or when making comparisons to production volumes. Because ONRR processes royalty transactions daily, the Sales Year data constantly changes. For this reason, the Sales Year datasets are published with an as-of date.  

### What are transaction codes (TC)? 

Transaction codes are used transactions on Form ONRR-2014 and organized by function. This dataset does not include all the transaction codes. Other datasets on the site that come from Form ONRR-2014 include all the transaction codes. There are several reasons why some transaction codes are excluded for this data set. The reasons include not specific to royalty collection, being used to only provide estimates, not relating to oil and gas products, not having royalties reported, or relating to minimum payments. 
<br />
Below are the transaction codes included in the dataset.

### How are quality gravity bank adjustments calculated?

Quality Gravity bank adjustments are made prior to any allowances taking place and included in the reporting. Gravity Bank Adjustments (TC 13) are used to report the difference in quality (gravity) between oil measured at the BLM or BSEE-approved point of royalty settlement and the oil delivered to the refiner at the delivery point. The dataset rolls up the TC 13 adjustments with the TC 01 (Royalty) reporting for oil. (link to reg: See e.g. 30 CFR 1206.119.)

### What does “not tied to a commodity” mean?
As a part of the COVID royalty relief program reporters were not required to tie their reporting to a specific product code. Due to this ONRR is unable to allocate the reported information to the various products. In this dataset, “not tied to a commodity” references transactions that are identified as COVID royalty relief.

### What is COVID royalty relief? 

30 CFR 203.80 allows the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) the ability to grant special case royalty relief on a product or lease basis through an application-based process that adheres to strict criteria. BSEE granted limited royalty relief in 2020 and 2021 that is categorized as COVID royalty relief in our data set. COVID Royalty Relief is given its own category in this dataset as payors were not required to report a product.

### Fields and definitions

* **Calendar Year:** The year in which the data is reported for the period between January 1 and December 31 for a given year. This dataset is Sales Year data reported on a Calendar Year basis. 

Note: Sales Year and Accounting Year are different from Calendar Year and Fiscal Year. Refer to above definitions of sales year and accounting year.

* **Fiscal Year:** The federal fiscal year in which the data is reported for the period between October 1 and September 30 for a given year. For example, Fiscal Year 2018 is between October 1, 2017, and September 30, 2018.

**Land Class:** This field distinguishes federal lands and waters from Native American lands. All data in this dataset is federal.

* **Federal:**  [Federal lands](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42346.pdf) are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Federal lands include: public domain lands, acquired lands, military acquired lands, and the [Outer Continental Shelf](https://www.boem.gov/OCS-Lands-Act-History/).

**Land Category:**

* **Federal Onshore:** Lands that are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government and are situated or occurring on land. Onshore land includes public domain lands, acquired lands and military acquired lands.

* **Federal Offshore:** Submerged lands that are located farther than three miles off a state's coastline, or three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico off Texas and Western Florida and are owned by or under the jurisdiction of the federal government. [Outer Continental Shelf](http://www.boem.gov/OCS-Lands-Act-History/) lands are included.

**State/Offshore Region:** The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) separates offshore areas into four regions: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific and Alaska. For more information on offshore regions, including spatial boundaries, see the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's [maps and GIS data](http://www.boem.gov/Maps-and-GIS-Data/). The state name is also listed under this column.

<br />

**Revenue Type:** Revenues from U.S. natural resources fall into one of several types. This dataset contains only royalties and COVID royalty relief as revenue types.

* **Royalties:** A natural resource lease holder pays royalties after the lease starts producing a commodity in paying quantities. The amount is based on a percentage of the revenue from the commodity sold. The exact percentage is set in the original lease document that went along with the lease sale.

* **Covid Royalty Relief:** This amount is always negative. COVID Royalty Relief is given its own category in the data as payors were not required to report a product.

**Commodity:** The Department of the Interior collects revenues on over 60 different products, but you will only find Oil, Gas, NGL, and "not tied to a commodity" in this dataset.
<br />

**Sales Volume:** The volume of the mineral/resource sold. The unit of measurement is located under the commodity column.
<br />

**Gas MMBtu Volume:** The volume of gas converted from the sales measurement of mcf to the globally used energy value measurement.
<br />

**Sales Value:** The total value of the sale in U.S. dollars.
<br />

**Royalty Value Prior to Allowances (RVPA):** Calculated by multiplying sales value by royalty rate
<br />

**Transportation Allowances (TA):** Deductions in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee, or a deduction accepted or established by ONRR for moving coal from the mine or lease to a remote point of sale or delivery, or moving oil or gas , gas, or geothermal byproducts to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area.
<br />

**Processing Allowances (PA):** A deduction from Royalty Value for the lessee's actual, reasonable costs of processing a gas stream.
<br />

**Royalty Value Less Allowances (RVLA):** Calculated by subtracting allowances (Transportation, Processing) from Royalty Value.
<br />

**Effective Royalty Rate:** Calculated by dividing the reported Royalty Values Less Allowances by the reported Sales Value per OIG Report 2021-CR-042 June 2023.
<br />

Effective Royalty Rate = Total Royalty Value−Deductions ±Gravity Bank Adjustments / Total Sales Value
