# Plain Language

Plain language makes it easier for the public to read, understand and use government communications. 

## Plain Language Writing Act of 2010 

The purpose of the [Plain Writing Act of 2010 (PDF) <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-111hr946enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr946enr.pdf) is “to improve the effectiveness and accountability of federal agencies to the public by promoting clear government communication that the public can understand and use.” This law changed how the government communicates with the public and all government agencies are expected to follow the requirements outlined in this regulation. 

## Our Commitment 

Many aspects of the Department of Interior's programs and operations have a direct impact on the public, and it is vital that we communicate clearly and reliably. To learn how we’re implementing the Plain Writing Act, read our [plain writing implementation plan <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](https://www.doi.gov/plainlanguage/plain-writing-act).

- Writing in plain language.
