# Federal laws

There are many laws that govern natural resource extraction on federal lands.

## Fiscal regime

The laws in this section provide the backbone of the fiscal regime for the extractive industries.

## Fees and fines for extractive industries companies

There are other laws governing natural resources and extractive companies’ operations. Some of these laws require companies to pay fees. Violating some of these laws can also result in companies paying fines.

## Other laws

There are many other laws with which extractive industries companies must comply. Several federal agencies’ websites contain more comprehensive lists of laws they enforce:

## Regulations

Federal agencies implement laws by developing and enforcing regulations. The regulations below relate to natural resource extraction on federal and Indian lands.

* [Title 25 <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&searchPath=Title+25%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+I&granuleId=&packageId=CFR-2008-title25-vol1&oldPath=Title+25%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+A&fromPageDetails=true&collapse=true&ycord=435) in the Code of Federal Regulations relates to sovereign Indian nations. Subchapter I deals with energy and minerals (Parts 200–227).
* [Title 30 <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=784ea268c892a669424da1512740a933&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title30/30tab_02.tpl) governs mineral resources. [Chapter II <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=050aa7804f2ee861c64ba348d17a79c1&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title30/30cfrv2_02.tpl#0) deals with the BSEE; [Chapter V <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=050aa7804f2ee861c64ba348d17a79c1&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title30/30cfrv2_02.tpl#500) deals with BOEM; [Chapter VII <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=050aa7804f2ee861c64ba348d17a79c1&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title30/30cfrv3_02.tpl#0) deals with OSMRE; [Chapter XII <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=050aa7804f2ee861c64ba348d17a79c1&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title30/30cfrv3_02.tpl#1200) deals with ONRR.
* [Title 43 <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title43/43tab_02.tpl) in the Code of Federal Regulations governs public lands. Subchapter C focuses on minerals management (Parts 3000–3870).

Implementing laws includes complying with the [National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (PDF) <OpenInNewIcon style={{ fontSize: 20 }} />](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/pdf/USCODE-2010-title42-chap55-sec4321.pdf) (42 USC § 4321 et seq.). NEPA is intended to ensure that decision makers and the public have information about the potential impacts to the environment of proposed federal actions and alternatives to those actions. When taking any major action, such as leasing natural resources on federal lands for extraction, federal agencies must prepare an Environmental Assessment and, if applicable, an <GlossaryTerm>Environmental Impact Statement</GlossaryTerm>. The public has legally mandated opportunities to comment on these impact statements.
