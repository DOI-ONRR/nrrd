# Audits and Assurances

In the United States, data about revenue from the extractive industries are bound by rules and regulations. Companies and governments are accountable to internal and external oversight. This ensures correct reporting and publication of payments.

## Tracking and verifying payments

Companies and government agencies are each legally responsible for reporting payment data. Reported data must be both accurate and verifiable. Controls and standards help companies report correct data on the first attempt. Reports are verified after submission. Independent audits help ensure compliance with internal and external standards.
