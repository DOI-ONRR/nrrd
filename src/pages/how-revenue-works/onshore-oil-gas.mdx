# Onshore Oil & Gas

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has the authority to manage federal lands, including leasing certain lands for oil and gas development.

This responsibility was granted by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920. The Oil and Gas Management Program oversees onshore oil and gas wells on federal lands.

<DidYouKnowCard>

Exploration for oil and gas changed significantly in the early 2000s, with new applications of extraction methods, known as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, commonly called “fracking.”

<CollapsibleContent>

These methods made extracting oil and gas deep below the surface of the earth in shale rock formations profitable.

Hydraulic fracturing pumps water, sand, and chemicals into the earth to fracture the shale rock so that natural gas and oil can flow through the well to the surface. Major oil and gas shale rock formations in the U.S. include the Permian, Haynesville, and Eagle Ford Regions mostly in Texas; the Marcellus Region in West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York; the Niobrara Region in Wyoming and Colorado; and the Bakken Region in North Dakota and Montana.

<ProcessCard step={1} name={'Plan'}>

BLM field offices prepare comprehensive Resource Management Plans (RMPs). RMPs guide leasing decisions on federal lands.  This includes which lands are open to oil and gas leasing, and which lands are closed. BLM field offices develop RMPs in line with multiple-use and sustained-yield principles, and by engaging the public and various levels of government.

</ProcessCard>
<ProcessCard step={2} name={'Lease'}>

BLM field offices award leases for oil and gas resources on lands designated within RMPs during live lease auctions open to the public.  Auctions are held frequently, often quarterly. Before the live auction, the BLM field office estimates the <GlossaryTerm>fair market value</GlossaryTerm> for the natural resources in question.

During the live auction, bidders compete for a lease by placing bids. The BLM field office awards the lease to the highest bidder, so long as the bid is equal to or greater than the fair market value estimate. Once the BLM field office accepts a bid, the bidder must pay the <GlossaryTerm>bonus</GlossaryTerm> as well as the first year’s rent to BLM to secure the lease.

</ProcessCard>
<ProcessCard step={3} name={'Explore'}>

The lease holder must file an Application for Permit to Drill (APD) with the BLM field office. An APD allows a lease holder to explore the leased land for oil and gas deposits. To apply for an APD, lease holders must submit an Exploration Plan. The Exploration Plan includes information about the well and associated rights of way, roads, pipelines, and production facilities. After the APD is filed, there is a mandatory 30-day public notification period before the permit can be approved.

While reviewing the APD, BLM analyzes the impact of drilling on the environment using an <GlossaryTerm>Environmental Impact Statement</GlossaryTerm> or an Environmental Assessment in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. BLM must also ensure that conditions for the National Historic Preservation Act and the Endangered Species Act are met before awarding the permit.

Once granted, the APD expires within two years. During the explore phase, companies pay <GlossaryTerm>rent</GlossaryTerm> to ONRR.

</ProcessCard>
<ProcessCard step={4} name={'Develop'}>

The APD is one of many permits a lease holder must obtain.  It allows permit holders to move from exploration to development and production. Once operators and lease holders get all needed permits and licenses, companies build their operations and extract oil and gas from federal lands.

During development and production, the BLM field office performs several inspections.  Inspections enforce lease terms and track health, safety, and environmental concerns. When operators extract oil or gas in paying quantities, the lease holder stops paying rent and starts paying <GlossaryTerm>royalties</GlossaryTerm> to ONRR.

</ProcessCard>
<ProcessCard step={5} name={'Decommission and reclaim'}>

Even before the close of an oil and gas operation, operators and lease holders must begin <GlossaryTerm>reclamation</GlossaryTerm>. Before an operation begins, the operator includes a Reclamation Plan in the Surface Use Plan that must be approved by BLM.

The lease holder also posts a bond of at least $10,000. BLM holds that bond during the operation to enforce lease terms and reclamation. The operator must conduct interim reclamation throughout the life of the operation.  This concludes with appropriately plugging wells and restoring the ecosystem.

The BLM field office performs inspections throughout the operation. Inspections ensure that interim reclamation takes place, wells are appropriately plugged, and the ecosystem returns.
