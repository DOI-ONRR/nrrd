# How Revenue Works

Private individuals and corporations as well as the federal, state, and local governments can own the land and the resources beneath it. This makes the U.S. different from nearly every other country. In many places, oil, gas, coal, and other minerals belong to the government. But in the U.S. there is widespread private ownership of these resources.

            Once a piece of leased land starts producing a commodity, like oil, the producer generally sells it. Though, the producer may also use it on the lease or disposes of it. The proceeds of selling the commodity are subject to royalties, which result in revenue to the government.
