State/Offshore Region,"The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) separates offshore areas into four regions: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Pacific and Alaska.

Revenue Type,Revenues from U.S. natural resources fall into one of several types. This dataset contains only royalties and COVID royalty relief as revenue types.
Royalties,A natural resource lease holder pays royalties after the lease starts producing a commodity in paying quantities. The amount is based on a percentage of the revenue from the commodity sold. The exact percentage is set in the original lease document that went along with the lease sale.
Commodity,"The Department of the Interior collects revenues on over 60 different products, but there are only oil, gas, NGL, and ""not tied to a commodity"" in this dataset. “Not Tied to a Commodity” references COVID Royalty Relief data."
Sales Volume,"The volume of the product sold or removed from the lease or agreement and is attributable to the lease or to the lease-agreement combination, sales type code, product code, and sales month reported. The unit of measurement is located under the commodity column. The sales volume (or quantity, if geothermal) reported corresponds to the portion of the total production from the lease or from the lease-agreement combination. This is an industry reported value on the Form ONRR-2014."
Gas MMBtu Volume,Volume measured in Million British Thermal Units. One British Thermal Unit (Btu) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. MMBtu is the globally used energy value measurement.
Sales Value,The total value of the sale in U.S. dollars.
Royalty Value Prior to Allowances (RVPA),Calculated by multiplying sales value by royalty rate.
Transportation Allowances (TA)," Deductions in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee, or a deduction accepted or established by ONRR for moving coal from the mine or lease to a remote point of sale or delivery, or moving oil or gas , gas, or geothermal byproducts to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area."
Processing Allowances (PA),"A deduction from Royalty Value for the lessee's actual, reasonable costs of processing a gas stream."
Royalty Value Less Allowances (RVLA),"Calculated by subtracting allowances (Transportation, Processing) from Royalty Value."
Effective Royalty Rate,The calculation of the effective royalty rate is recommended by The Office of Inspector General (OIG) Report 2021-CR-042 June 2023.
