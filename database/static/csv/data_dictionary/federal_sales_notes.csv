*What is the difference between Accounting Year and  Sales Year data?,,,,
"Accounting Year data represent all transactions that the ONRR accepted into our Financial System during a given fiscal or calendar year. This data set contains transactions for sales that took place in the current fiscal year, as well as adjusted or corrected transactions for sales that took place in previous fiscal years. Because revenues are generally disbursed in the same year they were reported and accepted into the ONRR’s Financial System, Accounting Year data are most useful when analyzing dollars the ONRR collected and disbursed in a given fiscal year. Because they include adjusted or corrected  transactions for previous sales periods, Accounting Year data should not be used for trending purposes or for analyzing sales volumes.",,,,
"Sales Year data represent transactions for sales that took place in a given fiscal or calendar year and do not include adjusted or corrected  transactions for sales that took place in
previous fiscal years. This data set provides a “snapshot” of reported sales of mineral commodities, and is most useful when trending sales volumes or when making comparisons to production volumes. Because the ONRR processes royalty transactions on a daily basis, the Sales Year data constantly changes.  For this reason, the ONRR publishes sales year datasets with an as-of date showing when the information was current.",,,,
