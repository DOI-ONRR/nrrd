Revenue Type,Revenues from U.S. natural resources fall into one of several types.
Royalties,A natural resource lease holder pays royalties after the lease starts producing a commodity in paying quantities. The amount is based on a percentage of the revenue from the commodity sold. The exact percentage is set in the original lease document that went along with the lease sale.
Bonus,The amount paid by the highest successful bidder for a natural resource lease. The winning bid.
Rents,"A natural resource lease might not produce anything in paying quantities for some time after it is sold. Until it does, periodic payments are made for the right to continue exploration and development of the land for future natural resource production. These payments are called rent."
Civil Penalties,"ONRR issues civil penalties when companies fail to comply with, or knowingly or willfully violate, regulations or laws."
Inspection Fees,The Department of the Interior inspects offshore oil and gas drilling rigs at least once a year. Inspection fees help recover some of the costs associated with these inspections.

Revenue,Total Revenue
Oil & Gas (pre-production),"The commodity category used for offshore oil and gas rents and bonuses. At the time of lease sale, it isn‚Äôt known whether a lease will produce oil, gas or both oil and gas. After a lease starts producing a commodity (or commodities), the lease owner starts paying royalties. These can then be associated with either oil or gas. Hence, rent and bonus lines of data will be associated with an ‚ÄúOil or Gas (pre-production)‚Äù commodity type, while royalty lines of data will be associated with either ‚ÄúOil‚Äù or ‚ÄúGas‚Äù commodity types."
