Revenue Type,Revenues from U.S. natural resources fall into one of several types.

Bonus,The amount paid by the highest successful bidder for a natural resource lease. The winning bid.
Rents,"A natural resource lease might not produce anything in paying quantities for some time after it is sold. Until it does, periodic payments are made for the right to continue exploration and development of the land for future natural resource production. These payments are called rent."
Civil Penalties,"ONRR issues civil penalties when companies fail to comply with, or knowingly or willfully violate, regulations or laws."

Revenue,Total Revenue
Oil or Gas (pre-production),"The commodity category used for offshore oil and gas rents and bonuses. At the time of lease sale, it isn’t known whether a lease will produce oil, gas or both oil and gas. After a lease starts producing a commodity (or commodities), the lease owner starts paying royalties. These can then be associated with either oil or gas. Hence, rent and bonus lines of data will be associated with an “Oil or Gas (pre-production)” commodity type, while royalty lines of data will be associated with either “Oil” or “Gas” commodity types."
