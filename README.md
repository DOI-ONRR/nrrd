## What

The U.S. earns revenue on natural resources (such as oil, gas, coal and geothermal(s) extracted from federal lands and waters. This is a major source of revenue for both the federal government, state governments, and local municipalities.

This repository contains the code for revenuedata.doi.gov, which is a website that includes both curated content and raw data to better inform the national and international conversation around extractive industries revenue. It will provide data visualizations and information thatâ€™s  understandable to members of the public and can be re-used through other media and applications.

## Development Notes

### Testing

For testing our website we use the following libraries and frameworks:

 - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Code syntax and formatting
 - [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/): Javascript Testing Framework
 - [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/intro): Integration, Unit testing
 - [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer): End to End testing
 - [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse): Performance and Accessibility testing

The goal is to have 100% test coverage to support our Test Driven Development (TDD), continuous integration and ensure quality code delivery and user experience.

We use CircleCI to run our tests when a change is committed to our code base. Of course all tests can be run from the development environment.
